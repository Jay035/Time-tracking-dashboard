### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate functionalities with the use of "useState" and "useEffect" much better


```css
.proudOfThisCSS{
  padding-top: 2.8em;
  margin-block: 2em;
  border-radius: 15px;
  position: relative;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position-y: -5%;
  background-position-x: 400px;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]),
        [selected, setSelected] = useState("weekly"),
        tabList = [
          {
            id: "daily",
            time: "Daily"
          },
          {
            id: "weekly",
            time: "Weekly"
          },
          {
            id: "monthly",
            time: "Monthly"
          }
        ];
        useEffect(() => {
          switch(selected){
            case "daily" :
              setData(DailyData);
              break;
            case "weekly" :
              setData(WeeklyData);
              break;
            case "monthly" :
              setData(MonthlyData);
              break;
              default:
                setData(WeeklyData)
          }
        }, [selected])
}
```
